The tech armor I phone 5 anti glare and anti fingerprint iphone 5 cover fits very good and works great.
When least you think so, this product will save the day. Just keep it around just in case you need it for something.
I have purchased about 3 of this items so far and I am still loving it like its the first time buying
Unfortunately they didn't work for me. They made me sick and throw up once of the two times I tried them
I love the looks of the phone case but the buttons were difficult to press.  I tossed it out after one week of struggling with it.
I have had my camera for about 2 weeks now. The pictures are great, it is so easy to use. I love it!!
